## Content

### Abstract
Queri is an application where users can ask and answer questions. Users have the option to either stay public on be anonmous when asking and answering questions. Users can vote for their or other user's questions to be featured on the front page. The User can only vote for a question once per question. Questions will cycle on the front page every 7 days so users will have enough time to answer questions if needed. Queri was made so users can ask any questions they have without being criticized or being biased and have a response to their answer.

### Introduction
Queri is a discussion tool where users can ask or answer questions with the option of staying public or anonmous. The objective of the application is to help people ask or answer questions without their identity being revealed to the public. Also, users will not be able to see the responses to the question unless they answer the question themselves. On Reddit, users would be able to see other user's responses and their response to that specific post might change because they saw that specific user's response.
