### Abstract
Queri is an application where users can ask and answer questions. Users have the option to either stay public on be anonymous when asking and answering questions. Users can vote for their or other user's questions to be featured on the front page. The User can only vote for a question once and only once (there is no exception). Questions will cycle on the front page every 7 days so users will have enough time to answer questions if needed. Queri was made so users can ask any questions they have without being criticized or being biased and have a response to their answer.

### Introduction
Queri is a discussion tool where users can ask or answer questions with the option of staying public or anonymous. The objective is to eliminate any biased towards other users and have users ask questions without them having feeling safe. Users should not be afraid of asking a question just because their posts can be traced or found by another person. On Reddit, users can see the responses to a post without answering the post so their answers may get swayed. We want to prevent that as we want users to get personal responses not swayed by other user responses.

When a user asks or answers a question, they will have the option to stay anonymous or public. Other users will not be able to see other user's profile so users can feel safe when asking or answering questions and not have the fear of their posts being traced or found by another person. Users will also not be able to see other user's responses to a specific question without submitting a response of their own. This is to prevent users from getting their personal responses swayed because they saw another user's response. 

## Main Content
The idea of staying anonymous or public is a feature for users to have an option for more sense of security. Users should the option of submitting questions and answer anonymously or not as our objective was for users to not be afraid of asking or answering questions online. We also wanted to remove users being bias therefore users having the option to stay anonymous would remove any sort of users being bias. 

Our work is novel with the anonymous feature. Our idea for this project is for users to ask and answer questions online while the option to stay anonymous or public to other users. Reddit has a similar structure to our idea where users can post but did not have an option to stay anonymous. Reddit is also a discussion tool so users can not only post questions but they can post information and etc. Our idea is for users to only post and answer questions online so users can have thier questions answered within a certain time frame.
