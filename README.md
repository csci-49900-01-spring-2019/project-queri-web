Users can vote for their or other user's questions to be featured on the front page. The User can only vote for a question once per question. Questions will cycle on the front page every 7 days so users will have enough time to answer questions if needed. Queri was made so users can ask any questions they have without being criticized or being biased and have a response to their answer.
