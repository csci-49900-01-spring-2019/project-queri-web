url:https://us-central1-projectq-42a18.cloudfunctions.net/queri/PATH_FOR_FUNCTION_GOES_HERE
Example
	Getting comments with url https://us-central1-projectq-42a18.cloudfunctions.net/queri/posts/categories/:name/:post_id/comments/
	Would be written as
		https://us-central1-projectq-42a18.cloudfunctions.net/queri/posts/categories/cooking/-L_l0hlb5ruq_EL_KcRP/comments/
	Where
		:post_id is L_l0hlb5ruq_EL_KcRP
		:name is cooking

note 3/12/2019:
	-Meta refers to like count & comment count
	-Identifiers are firebase created unique identification strings in the database. An example of this is -L_l0hlb5ruq_EL_KcRP. These are typically a property name. Also mind that these identifiers contain a "-" in the begining and should be included when making a call.
	-Yes. Calling these elements posts is confusing. Will update..
	-Some functions arent included here because we might have to discuss database architecture 
	-Tested with Postman software. If passing values through body gives any issues try changing header content type to:
		 "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
